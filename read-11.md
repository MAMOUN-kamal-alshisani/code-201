### images: 
1.__Controlling sizes of images in CSS:
You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. 
Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the 
images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest 
of the page without waiting for the image to download.__

2.___AligNing images Using CSS :
Rather than using the <-img>element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align 
images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:__

+ ***The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.***
+ ***New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.*** 
***These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.***

3.__Centering images Using Css :__
+ ***By default,images are inline elements.This means that they flow within the surrounding text***
***In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.***
- ***Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image***

1. __On the containing element,you can use the text-align property with a value of center.__
2. __On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.__

3. __Background Images :__
__The background-imageproperty allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire 
page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.
The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.__

__example : body {
background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");}__

4. ***Repeating Imagesbackground-repeat/background-attachment:***

### repeat
__The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used)__
