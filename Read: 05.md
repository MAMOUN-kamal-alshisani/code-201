~~# Read: 05 : Readings : Images, Color, Text.~~

## images :Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description,
***Images should...***
 - Be relevant.
 - Convey information.
 + Convey the right mood.
 + Be instantly recognisable. 
* Fit the color palette.

 ***To add an image into the page 
you need to use an <-img->
element. This is an empty 
element (which means there is 
no closing tag). It must carry the 
following two attributes :
1.src :
This tells the browser where 
it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL 
pointing to an image on your 
own site. 
2.alt :
This provides a text description 
of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.***

***and you can also alter the width and height of th img to fit the page anyway you like***
## Where to Place Images in Your Code?
***Where an image is placed 
in the code will affect how it 
is displayed. Here are three 
examples of image placement 
that produce different results:
1.before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new 
line after the image.
2.inside the start of a 
paragraph.
The first row of text aligns with 
the bottom of the image.
3.in the middle of a 
paragraph.
The image is placed between the 
words of the paragraph that it 
appears in.***
# summary :
***1.The <-img> element is used to add images to a 
web page.
2.You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the 
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the 
content of an image.
3.You should save images at the size you will be using 
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
4.Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or 
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

# colors in css and html:
***The color property allows you 
to specify the color of text inside 
an element. You can specify any 
color in CSS in one of three ways :***

***1.rgb values :
These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For 
example: rgb(100,100,90).
 2.hex codes :
These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80.
color names :
There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan.

# texts: 
***The properties that allow you to control 
the appearance of text can be split into 
two groups:
● Those that directly affect the font and its appearance 
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, 
and the size of the text)
● Those that would have the same effect on text no matter 
what font you were using (including the color of text and 
the spacing between words and letters)***

# what to know :
- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, 
weight, style, and spacing.
+ There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume 
most people will have installed.
+ If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are 
several options, but you need to have the right license 
to use them.
- You can control the space between lines of text, 
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned 
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be 
indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an 
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or 
when they have visited a link
