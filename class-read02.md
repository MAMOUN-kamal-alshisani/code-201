### html-text :

***When creating a web page, you add tags 
(known as markup) to the contents of the 
page. These tags provide extra meaning 
and allow browsers to show users the 
appropriate structure for the page.***

### Structural and semantic markup
* Structural markup: the elements that you can use to 
describe both headings and paragraphs.
* Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such 
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something 
you have written is a quotation (`and who said it`), the 
meaning of acronyms.

### Headings and paragraphs
### headings :
***Browsers display the contents of 
headings at different sizes. The 
contents of an -h1- element is 
the largest, and the contents of 
an -h6- element is the smallest. 
The exact size at which each 
browser shows the headings 
can vary slightly. Users can also 
adjust the size of text in their 
browser. You will see how to 
control the size of text, its color, 
and the fonts used when we 
come to look at CSS.***

 ### paragraphs :
***1.a paragraph consists of one or more sentences 
that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The 
start of a paragraph is indicated by a new 
 line.***
 ***2.-p-Text is easier to understand when it is split up 
 into units of text. For example, a book may have ***
 chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under 
 each heading there will be one or more 
 paragraphs.-/p-***
 
 ### Bold & Italic :
 ***By enclosing words in the tags 
-b-and -/b- we can make 
characters appear bold.
The -b- element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
presented in a visually different 
way (for example key words in a 
paragraph) although the use of 
 the -b-element does not imply 
any additional meaning.***

### By enclosing words in the tags 
***-i- and -/i- we can make 
characters appear italic.
The -i- element also represents 
a section of text that would be 
said in a different way from 
surrounding content â€” such as 
technical terms, names of ships, 
foreign words, thoughts, or other 
terms that would usually be 
italicized***

## summary
**HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs)
They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).**



# Introducing CSS
 **1.What CSS does**
 **2.How CSS works**
**3.Rules, properties, and values**

***css : allows you to create rules that specify how the content of 
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that 
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should 
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one 
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.***
## summary
***- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.
Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.***
***+ Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
***CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.***

# Basic JavaScript Instructions
***1.A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe.
2.Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value. 
3.Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 
4.Arrays are special types of variables that store more 
than one piece of related information. 
5.JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
6.Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
7.Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.***

# Decisions and Loops
***1.Conditional statements allow your code to make 
decisions about what to do next. 
2.Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) 
are used to compare two operands. 
3.Logical operators allow you to combine more than one 
set of comparison operators. 
4.if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
5.switch statements allow you to compare a value 
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
option if none match). 
6.Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
