### html lists :

***there are three types of lists in html :
1.order list : use the(<-ol-></-ol>) element to create the list and write a text between(<-li-><-/li>) and each line will be numbered.***

***-unordered list : use the (<-ul-></-ul>) element to create an unordered list and write a text between
(<-li-><-/li>) and in each line it will be renderd with bullets.***

***3.the definitions list : this list is created using <-dl><-/dl> element
and inside it there is <-dt><-/dt> and this contain the term inside it
and <-dd><-/dd> this conatin the definition of the tag inside it***

# boxes :
### dimention box :
***from the start the box is by default big enough to hold it content, using <-div><-/div>
it forms a box and you can manipulate with the size and the height of the box,
using css you write the following---- div.box {
                                           height:300px;
                                           width:300px; }
and also you can put a limitation on the how much a box can expand or shrink{
                                                                             min-width:300px;
                                                                             max-width:400px;}
the same goes for the height of the box too and lastly there is every box have
1.border
