***Many web pages act like electronic versions of these 
documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories 
in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance 
over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce 
facilities.
In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping 
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey 
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how 
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to 
structure documents. In this chapter you will:***

## extra markup :***The Evolution of HTML***
***Each new version was designed 
to be an improvement on the 
last (with new elements and 
attributes added and older code 
removed).
There have also been several 
versions of each browser used to 
view web pages, each of which 
implements new code. Not all 
web users, however, have the 
latest browsers installed on 
their computers, which means 
that not everyone will be able to 
view all of the latest features and 
markup.***
### like the following :
1.DOCTYPEs
2.Comments in HTML
3.ID Attribute
4.Class Attribute
5.Block Elements
6.Inline Elements
etc....
### HTML5 Layout :
1.The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of 
different parts of a web page and help to describe 
its structure.
2.The new elements provide clearer code (compared 
with using multiple <div> elements).
  3.Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements.
  4.To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
which is available free from Google.
  
### Process & Design
1.understand who your target audience 
is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
2.Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site
3.Wireframes allow you to organize the information that 
will need to go on each page.
4.Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps 
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
5.You can differentiate between pieces of information 
using size, color, and style.
6.You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you present.


# java the abc of programming :
***what is a script and how do i create one***
1.A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
2.Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of 
all the instructions.
3.Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically.
4.To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
