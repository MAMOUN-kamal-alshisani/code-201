# Domain Modeling :
***Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities,
their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.***

***A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.
As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.***

# What's a Table?
***A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV 
schedules, and sports results***
***The <-table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
<-tr>
You indicate the start of each row using the opening <-tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.) 
It is followed by one or more <-td> elements (one for each cell in that row). 
At the end of the row you use a closing </-tr> tag.<-td>
Each cell of a table is represented using a <-td>element. (The td stands for table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a closing <-/td> tag.

### Table Headings :
****The <-th> element is used just like the <-td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or 
a row. (The th stands for table heading.***

### Spanning columns : Spanning Rows
***The colspan attribute can be used on a <-th> or <-td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.****

## Long Tables :There are three elements that 
***elp distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows (which can contain different content).
These elements help people who use screen readers and also allow you to style these sections 
in a different manner than the rest of the table (as you will see when you learn about CSS).<-thead>The headings of the table should 
sit inside the <-thead-> element. <-tbody->The body should sit inside the <-tbody> element. <-tfoot>
The footer belongs inside the <-tfoot-> element.

# Functions, Methods, and Objects :
__*Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task.__ 

__+Functions can take parameters (information required 
to do their job) and may return a value.__ 

__+An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you.__ 

__-In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object.__ 

__-Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window.__

__*JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and 
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.__ 

__-Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data 
sets (and both can contain the other).__
