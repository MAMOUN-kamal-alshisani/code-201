# ~~Read: 12 - Docs for the HTML <-canvas> Element & Chart.js~~

## charts:
*__Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. 
They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.__*
***A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page.
It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.***

  ***now when you want to display numeric data it is better to use charts instead of tables or lists especially if the data is statistical
  it organizes and makes the displayed data understandable and not complicated.***

  In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context.Other contexts may provide different types of rendering;***
  
  ## 1. steps of using canvas:
 ***Find the Canvas Element you must find the <-canvas> element.This is done by using the HTML DOM method getElementById()***

***you need a drawing object for the canvas.***
***The getContext() is a built-in HTML object, with properties and methods for drawing:***

## 3.Draw on the Canvas :
***you can draw on the canvas:
Set the fill style of the drawing object to the color red:***

## Applying styles and colors:
***If we want to apply colors to a shape,there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.***

***fillStyle = color:Sets the style used when filling shapes.***

***strokeStyle = color:Sets the style for shapes' outline
